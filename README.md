# logscreenlyasset
Log asset config from Screenly Management script playlist dump file

Use like below. Need to pass the path to screenlymanagement.py, and then make dumppath dump the json file into the same directory as logscreenlyasset.py. Other than that you just need the asset title. Save to file just by redirecting output, for now.

logscreenlyasset.py --screenlymanagemnetpath "/path/to/screenlymanagement/" --dumppath "/path/to/logscreenlyasset" --assettitle "title of asset"
