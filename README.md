# logscreenlyasset
Log asset config from Screenly Management script playlist dump file

Use like below. Need to pass the path to screenlymanagement.py, and then pass a directory to dump the json file. Other than that you just need the asset title. Save to file just by redirecting output, for now.

logscreenlyasset.py --screenlymanagemnetpath "/path/to/screenlymanagement/" --dumppath "/path/to/logscreenlyasset" --assettitle "title of asset"
